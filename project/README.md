The screenshot shows a clear image of what our bulding looks and also in the top right corner the parameters that we are able to control are also shown.
These parameters get updated in real time.

## project-t4g8-3

The image below shows our trees and also the tree that can be parameterized (the blue tree in the back). In the shot it can also be seen the controls that allow
for the change of the tree's values.

## project-t4g8-4

Our helicopter is shown below and in it we can see the textures that were used as well as the objects that we used to create it. The main body and helices are made
of a metal looking texture and the window is made with a texture that resembles the glass used in a "real life" helicopter.
