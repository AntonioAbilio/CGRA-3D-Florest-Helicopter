### Difuse Light

We observed that when the light is behind the polygon we cound't see the polygonn.
However, after moving the light we started to see the color of the polygon appearing.

Moving the light to (x:2, y:2, z:1) we see that the polygon gets illuminated from the top right corner.
We also see that moving the camera does not affect the way light appears on screen. This is shown in the images down below:

This means that this type of light is not affected by the position of the observer.

### Specular Light

Specular light acts different when comparing against the difuse light. This is because specular light is affected by the
position of the observer.

This can be clearly seen in the images down below:

Changing the shininess we see that the object gets progressively darker as the shininess is higher.
This is expected as a shinier object means less spread of light thus it getting progressivelly darker and the beam of light more focused.
