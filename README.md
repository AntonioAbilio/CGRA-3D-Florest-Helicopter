This project is a 3D interactive scene developed for the CGRA course, integrating animation, shaders, and user controls. The simulation showcases a forest fire scenario where the user controls a helicopter to extinguish fires.

## Project Highlights

- **Helicopter Simulation**  
  A controllable and animated helicopter that lifts off from a rooftop heliport, collects water from a lake, and extinguishes fires in a forest.

- **Firefighting Building**  
  A modular fire station with configurable floors, windows, and rooftop heliport, including texture-based signage and emissive lighting during maneuvers.

- **Animated Forest Fires**  
  Fires are represented with animated geometry using shaders, simulating flame movement with vertex displacement and material effects.

- **Lake with Shader Effects**  
  The lake surface uses animated shaders to simulate water movement and serves as a source for the helicopter to refill its bucket.

- **Procedural Forest**  
  A dense forest composed of procedurally generated trees of varying heights, shapes, and colors, adding randomness and realism.

- **Sky-Sphere Panorama**  
  A panoramic skysphere that follows the camera position to simulate an infinite environment, optionally including animated clouds.

## Controls Summary

- **W / S** – Accelerate / Brake  
- **A / D** – Rotate left / right  
- **P / L** – Take off / Land or lower to lake  
- **O** – Drop water over fire  
- **R** – Reset helicopter to initial position  
- **Speed Slider** – Adjust movement and rotation sensitivity
